# Cerebral Beach Hackathon Project
### Sports and Media Track

## SportsConnect
**SportsConnect** is a program that helps users connect with an athlete based on basic personal questions. It matches you with an athlete who shares similar characteristics, making the connection more relatable.

## Expectations
We expect **SportsConnect** to become a trend where users engage with it for fun and post their results on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and more.

## Purpose
By using **SportsConnect**, users will not only learn more about athletes and their backgrounds but also gain insight into their achievements. A key takeaway from this project is addressing the tendency for athletes to be seen as just statistics. With the rise in sports betting, athletes often receive undue criticism and hate when they underperform, leading to mental health struggles. This program humanizes athletes, emphasizing their shared traits with everyday people.

## Benefits
1. **For Athletes:** This program portrays athletes as real human beings, helping them connect with people who share similar traits.
2. **For Fans:** It allows fans to gain more personal insights into their favorite athletes' backgrounds and lives.
3. **For Inspiration:** Users may see that athletes are not all that different from them and feel inspired to work hard toward their own goals.

## Future Improvements
- Improved UI/UX for a more engaging experience.
- More diverse and fun questions.
- Inclusion of fun facts, short videos, or gifs of athlete highlights.
- Utilizing AI and LLMs for a more dynamic and interactive structure to increase user engagement.
